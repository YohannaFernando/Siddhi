# Event Streams
The event stream definition defines the event stream schema. An event stream definition contains a unique name and a set of attributes assigned specific types, with uniquely identifiable names within the stream.

## Purpose
To define the schema based on which events are selected to be processed in the execution plan to which the event stream is attached.
